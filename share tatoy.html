<br>
        <p> Consistently I feel as if I accomplished something wrong or there is an off-base thing. What is this void inside me? 
 This horrendous inclination, how I wish this would immediately disappear. Living, all by itself, is 
 a struggle, I experience issues, I lie, I feel down, I become irate, essentially what typical individuals
  would feel and think. Learning I need to pay notice as well, would somebody be able to if it's not too 
  much trouble, clarify why I think and feel like this, well there is no one who will assist me I with 
  speculating. A ton of debilitation and negative energies around me, assist me with moving away from here. 
  Assist me with sorting out my life, I am worn out and I am distant from everyone else in this excursion.
   Life is so difficult, I stagger and fall. It's difficult to absolutely get up on account of the injuries 
   it left me, in my heart and my psyche. How I wish life was simple so I can just arrive at my fantasies and stroll through a way with nothing to thwart me.</p>
            <br>
           <p>However, life instructed me that the excursion I am on is entirely fine. Just getting by can be a struggle for the explanation that you need to battle. We stagger and fall, it's a course of getting the pieces once more. Avoid the antagonism, let those things in that satisfy you. Get up and stand. For individuals who long, the achievement is in their shadow. For I am alive, in light of the fact that I am as yet battling, for I am fearless and will constantly have confidence. Trust is there since I didn't visually impair my heart and brain. For I am me and I will be solid and fearless all of the time.

                 <p> In believing God in a way that would sound natural to him,
                     I feel alleviation just goodness and uplifting tones streaming into my spirit.
                      I have experienced a great deal this day, issues with scores and scholastics 
                      and everyday issues. Obstructions and difficulties are expected to confront 
                      and outperform and heaps of bearing are to be taken. Some of the time, I feel 
                      miserable and disheartened, with every one of the questions and laments and 
                      negative energies on me. I feel void inside now and then, and in a little while,
                       I made them believe that what I truly need is God. God is the one in particular
                        who hears and feels me so much even the smallest particle in my body should be 
                        visible directly through his sight. With God, the sky is the limit. With God, you
                         don't feel crushed and frustrated on the grounds that he will clear a path for me.
                          He made me flawlessly, with his motivation I stand. In following him, I get the best
                           sentiments, favors, and gifts of life. I had the option to comprehend life as I develop 
                           consistently. I love God and I  needed him. I feel in adoration with his words and I am honored 
                    to be one of his youngsters. I love you, God always even up to my 
                    most unimaginable damages and longings.

                <br>
                        <p>Assuming being fearless is an absolute necessity, 
                            well I certainly missing the mark on demeanor. Assuming 
                            that courage will be effortlessly moved by, would need some. 
                            Assuming timidity was the most grounded weapon, I truly do have it. 
                            Yet, in this world, bashfulness can truly affect you, well that is the best 
                            case for me. I'm a modest sort of individual, I don't generally leave my usual range of
                             familiarity since I am excessively apprehensive. Reluctant to make some noise, offer, talk, 
                             and impart. I have come here to share my experience of being excessively timid and what
                              it meant for me a great deal. I have my own objectives and plans to make and take, yet, 
                              that timidity of mine stood up and prevented me from acting naturally. I was in a real 
                              sense apprehensive due to my yearning for their endorsement and getting, suppositions, 
                              and remarks. How hard would it be able to be sufficiently daring? indeed, in a real sense, 
                              it is truly hard on the grounds that you want to take up such a lot of mental fortitude to 
                              stand up and talk. It is a long course of getting back the pieces, yet, I truly do put
                               stock in myself that I can advance in doing much so I can bear up for myself without 
                               being directed to and dazed by others. Desire is crazy, my heart will likely 
                            be courageous, stand up on the grounds that I can be who I am. I will feature to 
                            them who I really am. </p>

<br>
        <p>I am so worn out of the present moment,
           thus miserable simply need to be distant from 
           everyone else. I had another battle however presently versus the world, I composed this piece am so reluctant to try and complete it. For what reason do I feel like I am amidst karma? Why me? I asked again yet nobody and no answer come up. A revile, once in a while I would agree that it, I poured what I felt 100% in this composition. What is the issue? I have made an honest effort, depleted strength and frail soul meandered, and lost heart and brain. I have generally rehashed this line of mine, " bawi lang ko sometime later" however why I am as yet unfit to refocus. Single-word that can communicate what I am today, dismal. This crappy course in my mind simply continues to remind me how I have fizzled, modest and unfortunate all of the time. My heart then, at that point, responds making me weak. 
          Assuming I could travel back in time ensure I have crushed the dull, right my errors, and begin once more </p>

                          disposition of mine, or I didn't change, all things considered, two choices. 
                          I've conversed with myself through this composition, I will sort this out. 
                          Beginning tomorrow, I will change. I won't vacillate in giving a clarification. 
                        I will like each and every circumstance I will confront whether it is a test or a blessing. 
                        I will change. </p>
